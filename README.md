# Star Trek Adventures Website

Just what it says right there in the title of the readme. This is just a website I made to host some content for an STA game I'm running. I made sure all the licenses were in order and such and that I have all the attributions where they need to be, et cetera.

The live version of the site can be found here: https://geekkid1.github.io/sta-systems
